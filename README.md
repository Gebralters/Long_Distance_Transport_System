# 🚐 Comfort Cruize - Long Distance Door-to-Door Ride Sharing System

## 📖 Overview

**Comfort Cruize** is an innovative ride-sharing platform designed to enhance long-distance travel safety, convenience, and affordability in South Africa. The system uses 6-seater vehicles to provide **door-to-door transport** with a focus on **shared rides**, **real-time tracking**, and **passenger safety**—particularly in light of issues like human trafficking.

## 🏢 Company Background

In 2016, **Simon Maputla** founded **Devine Travel and Tours** after struggling with poor commuting experiences. Initially helping elderly, sick, and disabled individuals travel long distances, Simon ran operations through **WhatsApp**. However, as demand grew, the limitations of WhatsApp became apparent. This project represents a digital leap from manual WhatsApp coordination to an automated, secure, and intelligent ride-sharing system.
